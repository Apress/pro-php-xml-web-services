Pro PHP XML and Web Services
by Robert Richards

This is the code archive for Pro PHP XML and Web Services.

***** Note *****
A few of the scripts in this archive have been updated from the printed code in some chapters. For example, the code for XMLReader in chapter 9 has been updated to use the XMLReader class constants rather than the library constants, which have been removed from the XMLReader extension.


There are three different naming conventions used to identify scripts within the chapters.
- Files identified by a specific name within a chapter are named the same within the archive.
- Unnamed code within a listing is identified by the listing number. For example, the code for Listing 5-4 is named listing5-4.php.
- There are also cases where code has been broken out throughout a section. This code has been re-assembled within the archive as a complete script and is named by the name of the section it falls within the chapter. For example in chapter 6 the code for creating and editing an XML tree is found throughout the section titled "Creating and Editing a Tree". The corresponding filename within the archive is named creating_and_editing_a_tree.php.
- Lastly, most chapters include a section for examples. When a single example is included in a chapter, the filename is example.php, otherwise a number signifying the example number is appended to the name. For instance, in chapter 6, the example titled "Building a Portable Application Description Template" is named example1.php and the example titled "Building an XSL Template" is named example2.php.
